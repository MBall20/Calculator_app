# Overview

This app is a continuation from my previous livestock weight calculator using Kotlin. The user is able to input a birth date and end date (sale date) and calculate
the estimated weight of the animal. The goal is to help the grower maximise their profits by selling at the most opportune time. Creating an app allows for it to be used
any time, rather than when sitting at a computer.

The purpose of creating this app was to practice creating a single screen mobile app.
